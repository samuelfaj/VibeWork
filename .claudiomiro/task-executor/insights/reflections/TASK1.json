          "raw": "# TASK1 Reflection — Docker Compose Local Development Environment\n\n## Iteration: 1\n\n---\n\n## Key Insights\n\n### Patterns (Positive)\n\n- **Environment variable defaults with fallback syntax work well for optional config.** Using `${VAR:-default}` pattern in docker-compose.yml provides sensible defaults while allowing override. [confidence: 0.95] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n  - Evidence: `MYSQL_DATABASE: ${MYSQL_DATABASE:-vibe_db}` reduces friction for developers who just want to start quickly.\n\n- **Health checks with generous start_period prevent false failures.** Setting `start_period: 30s` for MySQL and MongoDB accounts for database initialization time. [confidence: 0.9] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n  - Evidence: Databases need time to initialize on first run; without start_period, health checks fail prematurely.\n\n- **Documenting required ports in .env.example reduces onboarding friction.** Explicitly listing port requirements (3306, 27017, 6379, 8085) helps developers identify conflicts early. [confidence: 0.85] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n\n- **Using named volumes over bind mounts simplifies cross-platform development.** `mysql_data` and `mongodb_data` volumes work consistently across macOS, Linux, and Windows. [confidence: 0.9] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n\n### Anti-Patterns (Negative)\n\n- **Task marked TODO items as complete without runtime verification.** Items 1 and 2 were marked `[X]` despite Item 3 (verification) being blocked. This creates a false sense of completion. [confidence: 0.9] [category: antiPatterns] (actionable: yes)\n  - Notes: Future tasks should clearly distinguish between \"code written\" and \"fully verified\" states.\n\n- **No health check configured for Pub/Sub emulator.** Unlike MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis, the pubsub service lacks a healthcheck block. This could cause dependent services to start before the emulator is ready. [confidence: 0.85] [category: antiPatterns] (actionable: yes)\n  - Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:52-59` — pubsub service has no healthcheck definition.\n\n### Testing Insights\n\n- **Docker daemon dependency blocks automated verification in CI-less environments.** Manual verification requires Docker to be running, which may not always be available during task execution. [confidence: 0.9] [category: testing] (actionable: yes)\n  - Notes: Consider adding a `docker-compose config --quiet` as minimum validation step that doesn't require running daemon.\n\n- **YAML syntax validation (`docker-compose config`) was completed successfully.** This is a good first-pass verification that catches structural errors before runtime. [confidence: 0.95] [category: testing] (actionable: no)\n\n### Project-Specific\n\n- **GCP Pub/Sub emulator image is large (~1GB).** This was correctly documented in .env.example but could impact CI/CD build times and developer onboarding. [confidence: 0.85] [category: projectSpecific] (actionable: yes)\n  - Notes: Consider pre-pulling this image in CI or documenting expected first-run time.\n\n- **Redis is for caching only, not event bus.** Task correctly implements Redis without message queue configuration, following project constraint that Pub/Sub handles messaging. [confidence: 0.95] [category: projectSpecific] (actionable: no)\n  - Evidence: AI_PROMPT.md explicitly states \"Redis = Cache Only: use Google Pub/Sub for messaging\".\n\n### Security\n\n- **Secrets are properly externalized via environment variables.** No hardcoded passwords in docker-compose.yml; all sensitive values reference `${VAR}`. [confidence: 0.95] [category: security] (actionable: no)\n  - Evidence: `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}` requires .env file.\n\n- **Services are bound to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) by default.** While acceptable for local dev, this could expose services on shared networks. [confidence: 0.7] [category: security] (actionable: yes)\n  - Notes: Consider documenting that this is local-dev only; production will use different networking.\n\n### Performance\n\n- **Health check intervals (10s) are reasonable for local development.** Balances responsiveness with resource usage. [confidence: 0.85] [category: performance] (actionable: no)\n\n---\n\n## Risks Identified\n\n1. **Incomplete verification** — Task cannot be fully accepted until Docker runtime tests pass. Risk: downstream tasks (TASK5-TASK8, TASK11) may encounter issues.\n2. **Pub/Sub emulator lacks health check** — May cause race conditions when backend services depend on pubsub being ready.\n3. **Port conflicts not automatically detected** — If ports 3306, 27017, 6379, or 8085 are in use, docker-compose will fail with cryptic errors.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations for Next Iteration\n\n1. Add health check for pubsub service (use HTTP probe on port 8085)\n2. Complete runtime verification when Docker daemon is available\n3. Consider adding `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy` for service startup ordering\n4. Add a script (`scripts/dev-setup.sh`) that validates ports are free before starting\n\n---\n\n## Completion Status\n\n- **Code artifacts:** COMPLETE (docker-compose.yml, .env.example created correctly)\n- **Runtime verification:** BLOCKED (Docker daemon not running)\n- **Overall:** PARTIAL — requires Docker verification to fully close\n\n",

          "raw": "# TASK1 Reflection — Iteration 2\n\n## Patterns\n\n- **Environment variable defaults with `${VAR:-default}` syntax reduce developer friction.** This pattern allows quick starts while preserving override capability. [confidence: 0.95] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: `MYSQL_DATABASE: ${MYSQL_DATABASE:-vibe_db}` lets developers start without custom config.\n\n- **Health checks require generous `start_period` for databases.** 30-second start periods for MySQL and MongoDB account for initialization time, preventing premature failure detection. [confidence: 0.92] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:16-17` and `docker-compose.yml:33-35` define `start_period: 30s`.\n\n- **Named volumes over bind mounts simplify cross-platform development.** `mysql_data` and `mongodb_data` work consistently across macOS, Linux, and Windows without path translation issues. [confidence: 0.90] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n\n- **Consistent health check intervals (10s) balance responsiveness with resource usage.** Too frequent checks waste resources; too infrequent delays issue detection. [confidence: 0.85] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n- **Marking TODO items complete without runtime verification creates false completion signals.** Items 1 and 2 were marked `[X]` while Item 3 remained blocked, suggesting artifacts were written but not tested. [confidence: 0.92] [category: antiPatterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Future tasks should distinguish \"code written\" from \"verified working\" states explicitly.\n\n- **Missing health check on Pub/Sub emulator breaks service dependency guarantees.** Unlike other services, pubsub lacks a healthcheck block, causing potential race conditions when dependent services start. [confidence: 0.88] [category: antiPatterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:52-59` — pubsub service has no healthcheck definition.\n\n- **Services bound to `0.0.0.0` by port mapping exposes them on all network interfaces.** While acceptable for local dev, this could expose services on shared networks. [confidence: 0.75] [category: security] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Production deployments need explicit network binding; document this is local-dev only.\n\n## Testing\n\n- **YAML syntax validation via `docker-compose config --quiet` is a valuable first-pass gate.** Catches structural errors without requiring Docker daemon. [confidence: 0.95] [category: testing] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: This passed and caught potential issues early.\n\n- **Docker daemon dependency blocks automated verification in daemon-less environments.** Manual runtime verification requires Docker running, which may not be available during CI or task execution phases. [confidence: 0.90] [category: testing] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Include `docker-compose config` as minimum CI validation step.\n\n- **Missing port conflict detection leads to cryptic startup failures.** If ports 3306, 27017, 6379, or 8085 are occupied, docker-compose fails without helpful error messages. [confidence: 0.82] [category: testing] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Consider adding a pre-flight check script that validates port availability.\n\n## Project-Specific\n\n- **Redis correctly configured for caching only, not messaging.** Task follows project constraint that Pub/Sub handles async messaging. [confidence: 0.95] [category: projectSpecific] (actionable: no)\n  Evidence: AI_PROMPT.md explicitly states \"Redis = Cache Only: use Google Pub/Sub for messaging\".\n\n- **Secrets properly externalized via environment variables.** No hardcoded passwords in docker-compose.yml; all sensitive values reference `${VAR}`. [confidence: 0.95] [category: security] (actionable: no)\n  Evidence: `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}` requires .env file.\n\n- **GCP Pub/Sub emulator image is ~1GB and impacts first-run experience.** Correctly documented in .env.example but could affect CI/CD build times significantly. [confidence: 0.85] [category: performance] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Consider pre-pulling in CI pipelines or caching image layers.\n\n## Security\n\n- **No secrets hardcoded — all sensitive values via environment variables.** This follows 12-factor app principles correctly. [confidence: 0.95] [category: security] (actionable: no)\n\n- **.env.example documents variables without containing real secrets.** Safe to commit while providing clear onboarding guidance. [confidence: 0.95] [category: security] (actionable: no)\n\n## Performance\n\n- **N/A for local development environment.** No specific performance targets needed for this task. [confidence: 0.95] [category: performance] (actionable: no)\n\n---\n\n## Actionable Improvements\n\n1. **Add health check for pubsub service** to ensure consistent startup ordering guarantees across all services. [priority: high]\n\n2. **Complete runtime verification** when Docker daemon becomes available. Current status is BLOCKED but artifacts are complete. [priority: high]\n\n3. **Add `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`** for services that need startup ordering (relevant when backend services are added). [priority: medium]\n\n4. **Create pre-flight port check script** (`scripts/check-ports.sh`) that validates required ports are free before starting. [priority: low]\n\n5. **Document local-dev-only nature** of current network configuration; production will use different networking. [priority: low]\n\n---\n\n## Task Status Summary\n\n| Aspect | Status |\n|--------|--------|\n| Code artifacts | COMPLETE |\n| YAML validation | PASSED |\n| Runtime verification | BLOCKED (Docker daemon) |\n| Overall | PARTIAL — requires Docker verification to fully close |\n\n---\n\n## Lessons for Future Tasks\n\n- Always attempt `docker-compose config` as minimum validation before marking Docker tasks complete\n- Distinguish between \"artifact created\" and \"verified working\" in TODO checkboxes\n- Include health checks for ALL services, even emulators, to maintain consistent startup guarantees\n- Document large image sizes (>500MB) as they impact CI and developer onboarding experience\n",
