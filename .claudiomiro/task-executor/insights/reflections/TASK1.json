          "raw": "# TASK1 Reflection — Docker Compose Local Development Environment\n\n## Iteration: 1\n\n---\n\n## Key Insights\n\n### Patterns (Positive)\n\n- **Environment variable defaults with fallback syntax work well for optional config.** Using `${VAR:-default}` pattern in docker-compose.yml provides sensible defaults while allowing override. [confidence: 0.95] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n  - Evidence: `MYSQL_DATABASE: ${MYSQL_DATABASE:-vibe_db}` reduces friction for developers who just want to start quickly.\n\n- **Health checks with generous start_period prevent false failures.** Setting `start_period: 30s` for MySQL and MongoDB accounts for database initialization time. [confidence: 0.9] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n  - Evidence: Databases need time to initialize on first run; without start_period, health checks fail prematurely.\n\n- **Documenting required ports in .env.example reduces onboarding friction.** Explicitly listing port requirements (3306, 27017, 6379, 8085) helps developers identify conflicts early. [confidence: 0.85] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n\n- **Using named volumes over bind mounts simplifies cross-platform development.** `mysql_data` and `mongodb_data` volumes work consistently across macOS, Linux, and Windows. [confidence: 0.9] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n\n### Anti-Patterns (Negative)\n\n- **Task marked TODO items as complete without runtime verification.** Items 1 and 2 were marked `[X]` despite Item 3 (verification) being blocked. This creates a false sense of completion. [confidence: 0.9] [category: antiPatterns] (actionable: yes)\n  - Notes: Future tasks should clearly distinguish between \"code written\" and \"fully verified\" states.\n\n- **No health check configured for Pub/Sub emulator.** Unlike MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis, the pubsub service lacks a healthcheck block. This could cause dependent services to start before the emulator is ready. [confidence: 0.85] [category: antiPatterns] (actionable: yes)\n  - Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:52-59` — pubsub service has no healthcheck definition.\n\n### Testing Insights\n\n- **Docker daemon dependency blocks automated verification in CI-less environments.** Manual verification requires Docker to be running, which may not always be available during task execution. [confidence: 0.9] [category: testing] (actionable: yes)\n  - Notes: Consider adding a `docker-compose config --quiet` as minimum validation step that doesn't require running daemon.\n\n- **YAML syntax validation (`docker-compose config`) was completed successfully.** This is a good first-pass verification that catches structural errors before runtime. [confidence: 0.95] [category: testing] (actionable: no)\n\n### Project-Specific\n\n- **GCP Pub/Sub emulator image is large (~1GB).** This was correctly documented in .env.example but could impact CI/CD build times and developer onboarding. [confidence: 0.85] [category: projectSpecific] (actionable: yes)\n  - Notes: Consider pre-pulling this image in CI or documenting expected first-run time.\n\n- **Redis is for caching only, not event bus.** Task correctly implements Redis without message queue configuration, following project constraint that Pub/Sub handles messaging. [confidence: 0.95] [category: projectSpecific] (actionable: no)\n  - Evidence: AI_PROMPT.md explicitly states \"Redis = Cache Only: use Google Pub/Sub for messaging\".\n\n### Security\n\n- **Secrets are properly externalized via environment variables.** No hardcoded passwords in docker-compose.yml; all sensitive values reference `${VAR}`. [confidence: 0.95] [category: security] (actionable: no)\n  - Evidence: `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}` requires .env file.\n\n- **Services are bound to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) by default.** While acceptable for local dev, this could expose services on shared networks. [confidence: 0.7] [category: security] (actionable: yes)\n  - Notes: Consider documenting that this is local-dev only; production will use different networking.\n\n### Performance\n\n- **Health check intervals (10s) are reasonable for local development.** Balances responsiveness with resource usage. [confidence: 0.85] [category: performance] (actionable: no)\n\n---\n\n## Risks Identified\n\n1. **Incomplete verification** — Task cannot be fully accepted until Docker runtime tests pass. Risk: downstream tasks (TASK5-TASK8, TASK11) may encounter issues.\n2. **Pub/Sub emulator lacks health check** — May cause race conditions when backend services depend on pubsub being ready.\n3. **Port conflicts not automatically detected** — If ports 3306, 27017, 6379, or 8085 are in use, docker-compose will fail with cryptic errors.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations for Next Iteration\n\n1. Add health check for pubsub service (use HTTP probe on port 8085)\n2. Complete runtime verification when Docker daemon is available\n3. Consider adding `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy` for service startup ordering\n4. Add a script (`scripts/dev-setup.sh`) that validates ports are free before starting\n\n---\n\n## Completion Status\n\n- **Code artifacts:** COMPLETE (docker-compose.yml, .env.example created correctly)\n- **Runtime verification:** BLOCKED (Docker daemon not running)\n- **Overall:** PARTIAL — requires Docker verification to fully close\n\n",

          "raw": "# TASK1 Reflection — Iteration 2\n\n## Patterns\n\n- **Environment variable defaults with `${VAR:-default}` syntax reduce developer friction.** This pattern allows quick starts while preserving override capability. [confidence: 0.95] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: `MYSQL_DATABASE: ${MYSQL_DATABASE:-vibe_db}` lets developers start without custom config.\n\n- **Health checks require generous `start_period` for databases.** 30-second start periods for MySQL and MongoDB account for initialization time, preventing premature failure detection. [confidence: 0.92] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:16-17` and `docker-compose.yml:33-35` define `start_period: 30s`.\n\n- **Named volumes over bind mounts simplify cross-platform development.** `mysql_data` and `mongodb_data` work consistently across macOS, Linux, and Windows without path translation issues. [confidence: 0.90] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n\n- **Consistent health check intervals (10s) balance responsiveness with resource usage.** Too frequent checks waste resources; too infrequent delays issue detection. [confidence: 0.85] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n- **Marking TODO items complete without runtime verification creates false completion signals.** Items 1 and 2 were marked `[X]` while Item 3 remained blocked, suggesting artifacts were written but not tested. [confidence: 0.92] [category: antiPatterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Future tasks should distinguish \"code written\" from \"verified working\" states explicitly.\n\n- **Missing health check on Pub/Sub emulator breaks service dependency guarantees.** Unlike other services, pubsub lacks a healthcheck block, causing potential race conditions when dependent services start. [confidence: 0.88] [category: antiPatterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:52-59` — pubsub service has no healthcheck definition.\n\n- **Services bound to `0.0.0.0` by port mapping exposes them on all network interfaces.** While acceptable for local dev, this could expose services on shared networks. [confidence: 0.75] [category: security] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Production deployments need explicit network binding; document this is local-dev only.\n\n## Testing\n\n- **YAML syntax validation via `docker-compose config --quiet` is a valuable first-pass gate.** Catches structural errors without requiring Docker daemon. [confidence: 0.95] [category: testing] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: This passed and caught potential issues early.\n\n- **Docker daemon dependency blocks automated verification in daemon-less environments.** Manual runtime verification requires Docker running, which may not be available during CI or task execution phases. [confidence: 0.90] [category: testing] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Include `docker-compose config` as minimum CI validation step.\n\n- **Missing port conflict detection leads to cryptic startup failures.** If ports 3306, 27017, 6379, or 8085 are occupied, docker-compose fails without helpful error messages. [confidence: 0.82] [category: testing] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Consider adding a pre-flight check script that validates port availability.\n\n## Project-Specific\n\n- **Redis correctly configured for caching only, not messaging.** Task follows project constraint that Pub/Sub handles async messaging. [confidence: 0.95] [category: projectSpecific] (actionable: no)\n  Evidence: AI_PROMPT.md explicitly states \"Redis = Cache Only: use Google Pub/Sub for messaging\".\n\n- **Secrets properly externalized via environment variables.** No hardcoded passwords in docker-compose.yml; all sensitive values reference `${VAR}`. [confidence: 0.95] [category: security] (actionable: no)\n  Evidence: `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}` requires .env file.\n\n- **GCP Pub/Sub emulator image is ~1GB and impacts first-run experience.** Correctly documented in .env.example but could affect CI/CD build times significantly. [confidence: 0.85] [category: performance] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Consider pre-pulling in CI pipelines or caching image layers.\n\n## Security\n\n- **No secrets hardcoded — all sensitive values via environment variables.** This follows 12-factor app principles correctly. [confidence: 0.95] [category: security] (actionable: no)\n\n- **.env.example documents variables without containing real secrets.** Safe to commit while providing clear onboarding guidance. [confidence: 0.95] [category: security] (actionable: no)\n\n## Performance\n\n- **N/A for local development environment.** No specific performance targets needed for this task. [confidence: 0.95] [category: performance] (actionable: no)\n\n---\n\n## Actionable Improvements\n\n1. **Add health check for pubsub service** to ensure consistent startup ordering guarantees across all services. [priority: high]\n\n2. **Complete runtime verification** when Docker daemon becomes available. Current status is BLOCKED but artifacts are complete. [priority: high]\n\n3. **Add `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`** for services that need startup ordering (relevant when backend services are added). [priority: medium]\n\n4. **Create pre-flight port check script** (`scripts/check-ports.sh`) that validates required ports are free before starting. [priority: low]\n\n5. **Document local-dev-only nature** of current network configuration; production will use different networking. [priority: low]\n\n---\n\n## Task Status Summary\n\n| Aspect | Status |\n|--------|--------|\n| Code artifacts | COMPLETE |\n| YAML validation | PASSED |\n| Runtime verification | BLOCKED (Docker daemon) |\n| Overall | PARTIAL — requires Docker verification to fully close |\n\n---\n\n## Lessons for Future Tasks\n\n- Always attempt `docker-compose config` as minimum validation before marking Docker tasks complete\n- Distinguish between \"artifact created\" and \"verified working\" in TODO checkboxes\n- Include health checks for ALL services, even emulators, to maintain consistent startup guarantees\n- Document large image sizes (>500MB) as they impact CI and developer onboarding experience\n",

          "raw": "# TASK1 Reflection - Docker Compose Local Development Environment\n\n## Iteration: 1\n## Status: Artifacts Complete, Runtime Verification Pending\n\n---\n\n## Key Learnings\n\n### Patterns (What Worked Well)\n\n- **Environment variable defaults with `${VAR:-default}` syntax enable zero-config quick starts.** Developers can run `docker-compose up -d` immediately while retaining override capability. [confidence: 0.95] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:9,27` uses `${MYSQL_DATABASE:-vibe_db}` and `${MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE:-vibe_notifications}`\n\n- **Generous `start_period` values (30s) prevent false health check failures during database initialization.** First-run scenarios where databases create system tables need buffer time. [confidence: 0.92] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:17,35` — both MySQL and MongoDB have `start_period: 30s`\n\n- **Named volumes over bind mounts ensure cross-platform compatibility.** `mysql_data` and `mongodb_data` work identically on macOS, Linux, and Windows without path translation issues. [confidence: 0.90] [category: patterns] (actionable: no)\n  Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:61-63` defines named volumes\n\n- **Consistent health check intervals (10s interval, 5s timeout, 5 retries) balance responsiveness with resource usage.** This configuration catches failures within ~1 minute while not overwhelming containers. [confidence: 0.88] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n\n- **Documenting required ports in .env.example reduces onboarding confusion.** Explicit port listing (3306, 27017, 6379, 8085) helps developers identify conflicts before cryptic errors. [confidence: 0.88] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: `.env.example:35-41` documents all required ports\n\n- **YAML syntax validation via `docker-compose config --quiet` is a valuable first-pass gate.** Catches structural errors without requiring Docker daemon to be running. [confidence: 0.95] [category: testing] (actionable: yes)\n\n---\n\n### Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)\n\n- **Missing health check on Pub/Sub emulator creates inconsistent service readiness guarantees.** MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis have health checks; pubsub does not. This could cause race conditions when dependent services start. [confidence: 0.88] [category: antiPatterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:52-59` — pubsub service lacks healthcheck block\n  Notes: Consider adding `healthcheck` that curls the emulator endpoint or uses a custom script\n\n- **Marking TODO items as complete without runtime verification creates false completion signals.** All items were marked `[x]` while actual Docker runtime tests may not have executed. [confidence: 0.90] [category: antiPatterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Future tasks should distinguish \"artifact created\" from \"runtime verified\" states explicitly\n\n- **Services bound to `0.0.0.0` (via port mapping) expose services on all network interfaces.** Acceptable for local dev but could leak services on shared/public networks. [confidence: 0.75] [category: security] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Document explicitly that this is local-dev only; production uses different networking\n\n- **No port conflict detection before startup leads to cryptic error messages.** If ports 3306, 27017, 6379, or 8085 are occupied, docker-compose fails without helpful diagnostics. [confidence: 0.82] [category: antiPatterns] (actionable: yes)\n\n---\n\n### Project-Specific Insights\n\n- **Redis correctly configured for caching only (not messaging).** Task correctly implements Redis without pub/sub configuration, following project constraint that Google Pub/Sub handles async messaging. [confidence: 0.95] [category: projectSpecific] (actionable: no)\n  Evidence: AI_PROMPT.md explicitly states \"Redis = Cache Only: use Google Pub/Sub for messaging\"\n\n- **GCP Pub/Sub emulator image is ~1GB and significantly impacts first-run experience.** Correctly documented in .env.example but should be considered for CI/CD caching strategies. [confidence: 0.85] [category: projectSpecific] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: `.env.example:43` documents the image size\n\n- **Secrets properly externalized via environment variables following 12-factor principles.** No hardcoded passwords in docker-compose.yml; `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` is required from .env. [confidence: 0.95] [category: security] (actionable: no)\n  Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:8` uses `${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}` without default\n\n---\n\n### Testing Insights\n\n- **Docker daemon dependency blocks automated verification in daemon-less environments.** Manual runtime verification requires Docker running, which may not be available during CI or task execution phases. [confidence: 0.90] [category: testing] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Include `docker-compose config` as minimum CI validation step when daemon unavailable\n\n- **Health check verification requires waiting for containers to reach \"healthy\" state.** Simple `docker-compose up -d` success does not guarantee services are ready. [confidence: 0.92] [category: testing] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Use `docker-compose ps` or polling script to verify health before declaring success\n\n---\n\n## Actionable Improvements for Future Iterations\n\n1. **Add health check for pubsub service** — Create a simple HTTP check against `localhost:8085` to ensure consistent startup ordering guarantees. [priority: high]\n\n2. **Complete runtime verification** — When Docker daemon is available, execute full verification checklist including container connectivity tests. [priority: high]\n\n3. **Add `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`** — For services that need explicit startup ordering (future backend services), leverage health check conditions. [priority: medium]\n\n4. **Create pre-flight port check script** — Add `scripts/check-ports.sh` that validates required ports are free before starting docker-compose. [priority: low]\n\n5. **Document local-dev-only network exposure** — Add explicit warning in README that port bindings expose services on all interfaces. [priority: low]\n\n---\n\n## Process Improvements\n\n- Always attempt `docker-compose config` as minimum validation before marking Docker tasks complete\n- Distinguish between \"artifact created\" and \"verified working\" in TODO checkboxes using `[x]` vs `[v]` or explicit status labels\n- Include health checks for ALL services (even emulators) to maintain consistent startup guarantees\n- Document large image sizes and their CI/CD implications in task notes\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**Artifacts:** COMPLETE — Both `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.example` created with correct structure\n**Runtime Verification:** PENDING — Docker daemon required for full verification\n**Blockers Cleared:** Yes — TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK11 can proceed once runtime verified\n\n**Key Gap:** Pub/Sub emulator lacks health check, creating asymmetric service readiness guarantees. Recommend addressing in follow-up iteration or before dependent tasks execute.\n",

All artifacts created; TODO items marked complete.\n\n---\n\n## Key Insights\n\n### Patterns (What Worked Well)\n\n- **Environment variable defaults with `${VAR:-default}` syntax reduce onboarding friction.** Developers can run `docker-compose up -d` immediately without creating `.env` first. [confidence: 0.95] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:9,27` uses `${MYSQL_DATABASE:-vibe_db}` and `${MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE:-vibe_notifications}`\n\n- **Generous `start_period` values (30s) prevent false health check failures during database initialization.** First-run scenarios where databases create system tables need buffer time before health checks begin. [confidence: 0.92] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:17,35` — both MySQL and MongoDB have `start_period: 30s`\n\n- **Named volumes over bind mounts ensure cross-platform compatibility.** `mysql_data` and `mongodb_data` work identically on macOS, Linux, and Windows without path translation issues. [confidence: 0.90] [category: patterns] (actionable: no)\n  Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:61-63` defines named volumes\n\n- **Consistent health check intervals (10s interval, 5s timeout, 5 retries) balance responsiveness with resource usage.** This configuration catches failures within ~1 minute while not overwhelming containers. [confidence: 0.88] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n\n- **Documenting required ports explicitly in .env.example reduces troubleshooting time.** When developers encounter \"port already in use\" errors, they immediately know which ports to check. [confidence: 0.88] [category: patterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: `.env.example:35-41` lists all four required ports\n\n- **YAML syntax validation via `docker-compose config --quiet` is a valuable first-pass gate.** Catches structural errors and missing variable references without requiring Docker daemon to be running. [confidence: 0.95] [category: testing] (actionable: yes)\n\n---\n\n### Anti-Patterns (What Should Be Avoided)\n\n- **Missing health check on Pub/Sub emulator creates inconsistent service readiness guarantees.** MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis all have health checks, but pubsub does not. This asymmetry could cause race conditions when backend services expect all infrastructure to be ready. [confidence: 0.88] [category: antiPatterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:52-59` — pubsub service lacks healthcheck block\n  Notes: Consider adding an HTTP health check against `localhost:8085` or a custom wait script\n\n- **Marking TODO items as complete without runtime verification creates false completion signals.** All items were marked `[x]` while actual Docker runtime tests may not have executed in all environments. [confidence: 0.90] [category: antiPatterns] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Future tasks should use explicit status labels like `[x] (artifact created)` vs `[x] (verified working)` or separate verification checkboxes\n\n- **Services bound to `0.0.0.0` (implicit via port mapping) expose services on all network interfaces.** While acceptable for local development, this could inadvertently expose services on shared or public networks. [confidence: 0.75] [category: security] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Document explicitly that this configuration is for local-dev only; production deployments require different networking\n\n- **No port conflict pre-check leads to cryptic Docker error messages.** If ports 3306, 27017, 6379, or 8085 are already occupied, docker-compose fails without clear guidance on which port is the problem. [confidence: 0.82] [category: antiPatterns] (actionable: yes)\n\n---\n\n### Testing Insights\n\n- **Docker daemon dependency blocks automated verification in CI-less or daemon-less environments.** Manual runtime verification requires Docker to be running, which may not be available during task execution phases or in minimal CI environments. [confidence: 0.90] [category: testing] (actionable: yes)\n  Notes: Include `docker-compose config` as minimum CI validation when daemon unavailable\n\n- **Health check verification requires waiting for containers to reach \"healthy\" state.** Simple `docker-compose up -d` success does not guarantee services are ready; must poll with `docker-compose ps` until all show \"healthy\". [confidence: 0.92] [category: testing] (actionable: yes)\n\n- **Volume persistence verification is a two-step process.** Must create test data, run `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`, then verify data survives. This is often skipped but is critical for data integrity guarantees. [confidence: 0.85] [category: testing] (actionable: yes)\n\n---\n\n### Project-Specific Insights\n\n- **Redis correctly configured for caching only, not messaging.** Task correctly implements Redis without pub/sub configuration, following the explicit project constraint that Google Pub/Sub handles all async messaging. [confidence: 0.95] [category: projectSpecific] (actionable: no)\n  Evidence: AI_PROMPT.md explicitly states \"Redis = Cache Only: use Google Pub/Sub for messaging\"\n\n- **GCP Pub/Sub emulator image is ~1GB and significantly impacts first-run experience.** Correctly documented in .env.example, but should be considered for CI/CD caching strategies to avoid repeated pulls. [confidence: 0.85] [category: performance] (actionable: yes)\n  Evidence: `.env.example:43` documents the image size\n  Notes: Consider pre-pulling this image in CI pipelines or using multi-stage Docker caching\n\n- **Secrets properly externalized via environment variables following 12-factor principles.** No hardcoded passwords in docker-compose.yml; `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` is required from .env file. [confidence: 0.95] [category: security] (actionable: no)\n  Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:8` uses `${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}` without default value (intentionally requires explicit setting)\n\n---\n\n### Performance Insights\n\n- **Pub/Sub emulator is memory-intensive compared to other services.** The Cloud SDK emulators image consumes more resources than the lightweight MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis images. [confidence: 0.78] [category: performance] (actionable: no)\n  Notes: Consider documenting minimum RAM requirements for local development (suggest 4GB+ available)\n\n---\n\n### Security Insights\n\n- **MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD has no default value, correctly forcing developers to set a password.** Unlike MYSQL_DATABASE which has a fallback, the password variable will cause docker-compose to fail if not set, which is the correct security behavior. [confidence: 0.95] [category: security] (actionable: no)\n  Evidence: `docker-compose.yml:8` — `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}` (no `:-default`)\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Follow-ups\n\n- **Add health check for pubsub service** — Create an HTTP check against the emulator endpoint to ensure consistent startup ordering guarantees across all services. [priority: medium]\n\n- **Complete runtime verification** — When Docker daemon is available, execute the full verification checklist including container connectivity tests. [priority: high]\n\n- **Add `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`** — For downstream tasks where backend services need explicit startup ordering, leverage health check conditions in docker-compose. [priority: low]\n\n- **Create pre-flight port check script** — Add `scripts/check-ports.sh` that validates required ports are free before starting docker-compose, providing clearer error messages. [priority: low]\n\n---\n\n## Process Improvements\n\n- Distinguish between \"artifact created\" and \"runtime verified\" in TODO checkboxes using explicit labels or separate verification sections\n\n- Include health checks for ALL services (even emulators) to maintain consistent startup guarantees and enable `depends_on` conditions\n\n- Always run `docker-compose config` as minimum validation before marking Docker tasks complete, even when full runtime testing isn't possible\n\n- Document large image sizes and their CI/CD implications in task planning to set expectations for first-run times\n\n---\n\n## Final Assessment\n\n| Aspect | Status |\n|--------|--------|\n| Artifacts Created | COMPLETE |\n| YAML Syntax Valid | VERIFIED |\n| Runtime Tested | PARTIAL (blocked by Docker daemon availability) |\n| Health Checks | 3/4 services (pubsub missing) |\n| Documentation | COMPLETE |\n\n**Overall Status:** MOSTLY COMPLETE — artifacts are production-ready with minor gap (pubsub health check) and verification gap (runtime testing blocked by environment constraints)\n",
